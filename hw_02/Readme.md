First we defined the variable "vowels" as all the vowels as strings 
Then we separated the first letter of the word and defined that as first letter 
And separated the rest of word and defined that as rest_of_word 
Then we created an if statement if the the first_letter is in the list of vowels then just retrun the whole word and "ay" 
but "else" meaning if its not a vowel return the rest_of_word followed by the first_letter followed by "ay"
